Chapter 1------------------------ 

Primary sources of law:
The source of American law derives from the U.S constitution and the constitutions of various states.
They also derive from statutes, or laws passed by Congress and by state legislatures.
Regulations created by administrative agencies, such as the federal Food and Drug administration.
And case law (court decisions). 

Secondary sources of law: are books and articles that summarize and clarify the primary sources of law. Legal encyclopedias, complications (such as Restatements of the law which summarize court decisions), or articles in law reviews published by law schools. 

Constitutional law: law expressed in the constitution. 

Statutory law: law enacted by legislative  bodies at any level of government, such as the statutes passed by Congress or by state legislatures. Statutory laws also include local ordinances—statutes (laws, rules, orders) passed by municipal or county governing units to administer matters not covered by the federal or state law. Ordinances commonly have to do with city or county land use, building safety code, etc. 

Uniform laws: laws that the NAtional conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws (NCCUSL) write so states can adopt. Only if a state legislature adopts a uniform law does that law become part of the statutory law of that state. Furthermore, states may choose to adopt only part of the uniform law or rewrite other sections. 

Administrative law: statutes of administrative agencies. An administrative agency is a federal, state, or local government agency established to perform a specific function. Rules issued by various administrative agencies now affect almost every aspect of business, including a firm’s capital and finance structure as well as hiring and firing procedures, etc. 

Pages 9 and 10, skipped,

Case law: court decisions. 

Common law: a body of general rules that applies everywhere. 

Precedent: that is, a court decision that furnishes an example or authority for deciding subsequent cases involving identical or similar legal principles. 

Stare Decisis: the practice of deciding new cases with reference to former decisions, or precedents. (to stand on decided cases). Under the doctrine of stare decisis, that court decisions and lower courts relative to that court must adhere to that principle and apply it to future cases. Stare Decisis has two aspects: (1) decisions made by higher courts are binding on lower courts, and (2) a court should not overturn its own precedent unless there is a strong reason to do so. 

Binding authority: any source of law that a court must follow when deciding a case. Binding authorities include constitutions, statutes, and regulations that govern the issue being decided, as well as court decisions that are controlling precedents within the jurisdiction. 

Persuasive authorities: precedents from other jurisdictions have no binding authority, and thus are called persuasive authorities. 

Remedy: the means given to a party to enforce a right or to compensate for the violation of a right/.

Equitable remedy: is really an action prescribed by the court to resolve the matter. This type of remedy is often used when there is simply no financial remedy available. In other words, there is no money to be given to the breached party.

Chapter 3------------------------- 

Justifications and Stuff

The body of American law includes the federal and state constitutions, statutes passed by legislative bodies, administrative law, and the case decisions and legal principles that form the common law. These laws would be meaningless without the courts to interpret and apply them. This is the essential role of the judiciary—the courts—in the American governmental system: to interpret and apply the law. 

The judiciary can decide among other things, whether the laws or actions of the other two branches are constitutional. The process for making such determination is known as judicial review. The power of judicial review enables the judicial branch to act as a check on the other two branches of government. 
The origins of judicial review in the United States, while not explicitly in the U.S Constitution, was around before 1789 when state courts had already overturned state legislative acts that conflicted with state constitutions. 

Before a court can hear a lawsuit, certain requirements must be first met. These requirements relate to jurisdiction, venue, and standing to sue. 

Juris means “law,” and diction means “to speak. Thus, “the power to speak the law” is the literal definition of jurisdiction. Before any court can hear a case, it must have jurisdiction over the person (or company) against whom the suit is brought (the defendant) or over the property involved in the suit. The court must also have jurisdiction over the subject matter of the dispute. 

Generally, a court can exercise personal jurisdiction (in personam jurisdiction) over any person or business that resides in a certain geographic area. A state’s highest court (often called the state supreme  court) has jurisdiction over all residents of that state. A court can also exercise jurisdiction over property that is located within aries. This kind of jurisdiction is known as in rem jurisdiction, or “jurisdiction over the thing.” 

Under the authority of a state long arm statute, a court can exercise personal jurisdiction over certain out-of-state defendants based on activities that took place within the state. However, the court must be convinced that the defendant had sufficient contacts, or minimum contacts, with the state to justify the jurisdiction. This means that the defendant must have enough of a connection to the state for the judge to conclude that it is fair for the state to exercise power over the defendant. Similarly, a state may exercise personal jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant who is sued for breaching a contract that was formed within the state, even when that contract was negotiated over the phone or through correspondence. 

Landmark Case: Marbury v. Madison (1803): judicial review

Because corporations are considered legal person, courts use the same principles to determine whether it is fair to exercise jurisdiction over a corporation, of which the corporation has its principal office, and is doing business in the state. Courts may apply the minimum-contacts test to determine if they can exercise jurisdiction over out-of-state corporations. The requirements are usually met if the corporation advertises or sell its product within a state, or places its good in the “stream of commerce” with the intent that the goods be sold within the state. 

Jurisdiction over Subject Matter is the limitation on the types of cases a court can hear. Both the federal and state court systems, there are courts of general (unlimited) jurisdiction and courts with limited jurisdiction.  An example of a court of general jurisdiction is a state trial court or a federal district court. An example of a state court of limited jurisdiction is a probate court. Probate courts are state courts that handle only matters relating to the transfer of a person’s assets and obligations after that person’s death, including matters relating to the custody and guardianship of children. An example of a federal court of limited subject-matter jurisdiction is a bankruptcy court. Bankruptcy courts handle only bankruptcy proceedings, which are governed by federal bankruptcy law. 

Original and Appellate Jurisdiction: The distinction between original and appellate jurisdiction lies in whether the case is being heard for the first time. Courts having original jurisdiction are courts of the first instance, or trial courts—that is, courts in which lawsuits begin, trials take place, and evidence is presented. In the federal court system, the district courts are trial courts. In the various state court systems, the trial courts are known by various names. Any court having original jurisdiction is normally known as trial court. Courts having appellate jurisdiction act as reviewing courts. In general, cases can be brought before appellate courts only on appeal from an order or a judgment of a trial court or lower courts. 

Federal question: a question that pertains to the U.S constitution, an act of Congress, or a treaty and provides a basis for federal jurisdiction in a case.

Federal courts can also exercise original jurisdiction cases involving diversity of citizenship. The most common diversity of citizenship cases have two requirements: 1) the plaintiff and defendant must be residents of different states and 2) the dollar amount in controversy must exceed $75,000. For purposes of diversity jurisdiction, a corporation is a citizen of both the state in which it is incorporated and the state in which its principal place of business is located. 

Concurrent jurisdiction: jurisdiction that exists when two different courts have the power to hear a case.

Exclusive jurisdiction: jurisdiction that exists when a case can be heard only by a particular court or type of court. 

Venue: Jurisdiction has to do with whether a court has authority to hear a case involving specific persons, property, or subject matter. Venue is concerned with the most appropriate physical location for a trial. Two state courts ( or federal ), may have the authority to exercise jurisdiction over a case, but it may be more appropriate or convenient to hear the case in one court than another. Basically, a court trying a suit should be in the geographic neighborhood (usually the country) where the incident leading to the lawsuit occurred or where the parties involved in the lawsuit reside. Venue in a civil case typically is where the defendant resides, whereas venue in a criminal case normally is where the crime occurred. Pretrial publicity or other factors may require a change of venue to another community, especially in criminal cases when the defendant’s right to a fair and impartial jury has been impaired. 

Standing to sue: A person must have a sufficient stake in the matter to justify seeking relief through the court system. In other words, to have a standing, a part must have a legally protected and tangible interest at stake in the litigation. The party bringing the lawsuit must have suffered a harm, or have been threatened by a harm, as a result of the action about which she or he has complained. Standing to sue also requires that the controversy at the issue be a justifiable controversy (something actual, as opposed to hypothetical or academic). 

The States and Federal Court Systems: 

A state court system will include several of levels: (1) a trial court of limited jurisdiction, (2) trial courts of general jurisdiction), (3) appellate courts, and (4) the state’s highest court, known as the state supreme court. Generally, any person is allowed to plead before the trial, then if he or she loses, can appeal to an appellate court.

Trial Courts: courts in which trials are held and testimony is taken. State trial courts have either general or limited jurisdiction. Trial courts have general jurisdiction as to subject matter may be called county district, superior, or circuit courts. 

Small claims courts: a special court that only hears small civil cases involving claims of less than a certain amount (varies from state to state). 

Local municipal courts: only hear traffic cases. 

Appellate, or Reviewing Courts: Courts of appeals do not conduct new trials, an which evidence is submitted to the court and witnesses are examined. Rather, a court panel of three or more judges reviews the record of the case and determines whether the court trial committed an error. Appellate courts generally focus on the question of law, not questions of fact. A question of fact deals with what really happened in regard to the dispute being tried. A question of law concerns the application or interpretation of the law, such as whether flag-burning is a form of speech protected by the First Amendment. Appellate courts usually give weight to trial court’s finding of fact because the appellate judges were not there to witness all the nonverbal communication happening in court. 

Highest State Court: ruling up here is absolute and can only be overwritten by the U.S Supreme Court. 

In New York and Maryland, the highest state court is called the court of appeals. 

The Supreme Court of the State of New York is the trial-level court of general jurisdiction in the New York State Unified Court System.

Litigation: the process of working a lawsuit through the court system. 

The complaint and answer (and the counterclaim and replay) taken together are called the pleadings. 

U.S District Courts: At the federal level, the equivalent of a state trial court of general jurisdiction is the district court. There is at least one federal district court in every state. 

U.S Court of Appeals or Circuit court: In the federal court system, there are thirteen U.S court of appeals, also referred to as U.S circuit court of appeals. It hears appeals from the federal district courts located within their respective judicial circuits, has national appellate jurisdiction over certain types of cases, like patents.

In order to bring a case to the Supreme Court, Appeals to the Supreme Court: writ of certiorari, (Rule of four) four supreme court justices must approve.



 
State Court Case Procedures: 
1.	The Pleadings: Plantiff’s complaint, services and summon, and defendant’s answer or motion to dismiss.
2.	Pre-trial motions: motion for judgment on the pleading (the judge will only grant motion if there are no dispute over the facts of the case and the sole issue to be resolved is a question of law), or a motion of summary judgment (court consider evidence outside the pleading, such as sworn statements (affidavits), or other documents relation to the case (ONLY granted if there are no genuine questions of fact and sole question is a question of law).  
3.	Discovery: depositions and interrogatories (series of written questions for which written answers are prepared by a party to a lawsuit), request for documents, admission, electronic discovery. 
4.	Pretrial Conference: Informal discussion between the judge and opposing counsel, explore the possibility of a settlement, or identify the real issues in dispute, and plan the course of the trial.
5.	Jury Selection: Trials can be with or without a jury (bench trial), Seventh amendment guarantees the right to jury trial in federal cases if the amount in controversy exceeds $20, Voir Dire (ask a set of questions to see if the potential juror is biased. 
6.	At the Trial: both sides make arguments and cross-examine whatever. At the end of the plaintiff’s case, the defendants attorney can call for “motion of directed verdict” on the ground that the plaintiff has presented no evidence that would justify granting the plaintiff remedy. 
7.	Post Trial motions: after the jury has rendered its verdict, the defendant may call for a motion for judgment n.o.v only if the jury’s verdict was unreasonable and wrong. If such a motion is granted, the judgment will go to the opposite party. 
8.	The Appeal: can only appeal if there are legitimate grounds such as there was an error made in court. 
9.	Enforcing the Judgment.

“alternative dispute resolution” (ADR) methods to resolve disputes that are inexpensive, relatively quick and leave more control with the parties involved.

1.	Negotiation: is informal discussion of the parties, sometimes without attorneys, where differences are aired with the goal of coming to a “meeting of the minds” in resolving the case.
2.	Mediation: Involves a neutral 3rd party, Mediator talks face-to-face with parties (who typically are in different adjoining rooms) to determine “common ground.”
3.	Arbitrator’s Decision. Settling of a dispute by a neutral 3rd party (arbitrator) who renders a legally-binding decision; usually an expert or well-respected government official.

Chapter 9---------------- 

Sources of Contract law: The common law governs all contracts except when it has been modified or replaced by statutory law, such as the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), or by administrative agency regulations. Contracts relating to services, real estate, employment, and insurance, for example, are generally governed by contract law, except sale and leases. 

Contract: an agreement that can be enforced in court. It is formed by two or more parties who agree to perform or to refrain from performing some act now or in the future. Generally, contract disputes arise when there is a promise of future performance. 

In determining whether a contract has been formed, the element of intent is of prime importance. In contract law, intent is determined by what is referred to as the objective theory of contracts, not by the personal or subjective intent, or belief, of a party. The theory is that a party’s intention to enter into a contract is judged by outward, objective facts as interpreted by a reasonable person, rather than by the party’s secretary, subjective intentions. 
Objective facts include (1) what the party said entering into the contract, (2) how the party acted or appeared, and (3) the circumstances surrounding the transaction. 	

Requirements for a Valid Contract:
1.	Agreement: an offer and an acceptance
2.	Consideration: something of value received or promised to convince the person to make this deal).
3.	Contractual capacity: both parties must be “competent” at the time to enter the contract. 
4.	Legality: the contract has to accomplish some goal that is legal and not against public policy. 

Bilateral Contracts: If the offeree can accept simply by promising to perform, the contract is a bilateral contract. Hence, a bilateral contract is a “promise for a promise.” Glen offers to buy me food if I’ll pay him back. I said I’ll pay him back the following week. 

Unilateral Contracts: If the offer is phrased so that the offeree can accept only by completing the contract performance, the contract is a unilateral contract. Thus, a promise for an act.” Glen said kill that man for me, and only then will I pay you. 

Revocation of Offer for Unilateral Contracts: Generally, offers are normally revocable before  they are accepted. However, once a performance is substantially undertaken, both parties are legally binded. 

Formal contracts are contracts that require a special form or method of creation to be enforceable. For example, negotiable instruments, which include checks, drafts, promissory notes, and certificates of deposit, are formal contracts because under the Uniform Commercial code, a special form and language are required to create them. 

Informal contracts (simple contracts) include all other contracts. No special form is required (except for certain types of contracts that include writing), as the contracts are usually based on their substance rather than their form. Typically, business-persons put their contract in writing to ensure that there is some proof of a contract’s existence should a problem arise. 

In express contracts, the terms of the agreement are fully and explicitly stated in words, oral or written. A signed leased for an apartment or house is an express written contract. If a classmate accepts your offer to sell your textbooks from last semester for $75, an express oral contract has been made.

Implied contract: the conduct of the parties, rather than their words, creates and defines at least some of the terms of the contract, certain requirements need to be met. (1) The plaintiff furnished some service or property. (2) The plaintiff expected to be paid for that service or property, and the defendant knew or should have known that payment was expected (based on the objective theory of contracts). (3) The defendant had the chance to reject the services or property but did not. 

A contract that has been fully performed on both side is an executed contract.

A contract that has been fully performed on either side is called ane executory contract. If one performed and the other did not. 

Quasi Contract: implied in law, and are wholly different from actual contracts. he concept of a quasi-contract is that of a contract that should have been formed, even though in actuality it was not.

Chapter 15-------------- 

In general contract law, the moment a definite offer is met by an unqualified acceptance, a binding contract is formed. In commercial sales transactions, the verbal exchanges, correspondence, and actions of the parties may not reveal exactly when a binding contractual obligation arises. The UCC states that an agreement sufficient to constitute a contract can exist even if the moment of its making is undetermined. 

Open Terms
Under the common law of contracts, an offer must be definite enough for the parties (and the courts) to ascertain its essential terms when it is accepted. In contrast, the UCC states that a sales or lease contract will not fail for indefiniteness even if one or more terms are left open as long as (1) the parties intended to make a contract and (2) there is a reasonably certain basis for the court to grant appropriate remedy. 
	The UCC provides numerous open-term provisions that can be used to fill the gaps in a contract. Thus, if a dispute occurs, all that is necessary to prove that the existence of a contract is an indication (such as a purchase order) that there is a contract. Missing terms can be proved by evidence, or a court can presume that the parties intended whatever is reasonable under the circumstances. 
	The quantity of goods involved must be expressly stated in the contract, however. If the quantity term is left open, the courts will have no basis for determining remedy. 

Open Price Term
If the parties have not agreed on a price, the court will determine a “reasonable price at the time for delivery.” If either the buyer or the seller is to determine the price, the price is to be set in good faith. Under the UCC, a good faith means honesty in fact and the observance of reasonable commercial standards of fair dealing in the trade The concepts of good faith and commercial reasonableness permeate the UCC. 
Sometimes, the price fails to be fixed (specified) through the fault of one of the parties. In that situation, the other party can treat the contract as canceled or specify a reasonable price.  

Open Payment Term
When parties do not specify payment terms, payment is due at the time and place at which the buyer is to receive the goods. The buyer can tender payment using any commercially normal or acceptable means, such as a check or credit card. If the seller demands payment in cash, however, the buyer must be given reasonable time to obtain it. 
	Case Example 15.3: Max agreed to purchase hay from Wagner’s farm. max left his truck and trailer in the farm for the seller to load the hay. Nothing was said about when payment was due, and the parties were unaware of the UCC’s rules. When Max came back to get the hay, a dispute broke out. Max claimed that he was given less hay than he had ordered and argued that he did not have to pay at the time. Wagner refused to release the hay or the vehicle but Max drove off. Max was prosecuted for theft because the parties had failed to specify when payment was due and payment was due at the time Max picked up the hay because of UCC-2-310(a). 

Open Delivery Term
When no delivery terms are specified, the buyer normally takes delivery at the seller’s place of business [UCC 2-308(a)]. If the seller has no place of business, the seller’s residence is used. When goods are located in some other place and both parties know it, the delivery is made there. If the time for shipment or delivery is not clearly specified in the sales contract, the court will infer a “reasonable” time for performance. 

Duration of an Ongoing Contract
A single contract might specify successive performance but not indicate how long the parties are required to deal with each other. In this situation either party may terminate the ongoing contractual relationship. Principles of good faith and sound commercial practice call for reasonable notification before termination, however, to give the other party time to make substitute arrangement. 

Options and Cooperation Regarding Performance 
When a contract contemplates shipment of the goods but does not specify shipping arrangements, the seller has the right to make these arrangements in good faith, using commercial reasonableness in the situation. 
When a sales contract omits terms relating to the assortment of goods, the buyer can specify the assortment. 
Example: Petry Drugs, Inc., agrees to purchase one thousand toothbrushes from Dental Supply Inc,. The toothbrushes come in all sorts of color but the contract does not specify the color. Petry, the buyer, has the right to take six hundred blue toothbrushes and four hundred green ons if it wishes. Petry, however, must practice good faith and commercial reasonableness in making its selections. 

Normally, if the parties do not specify a quantity, a court will have no basis for determining a remedy because there is no way to determine objectively what is reasonable. Nevertheless, the UCC recognizes two exceptions involving requirements and output contracts. 

In a requirement contract, the buyer agrees to purchase and the seller agrees to sell all or up to a stated amount of what the buyer needs or requests. 

Example 15.5: Wilson’s Cannery forms a contract with Al Garcia. The cannery agrees to purchase from Garcia, and Garcia agrees to sell to the cannery, all of the green beans that the canner needs or requires during the following summer. 
There is implicit consideration in a requirements contract because the buyer gives up the right to buy goods from any other seller, and this forfeited right creates a legal detriment (consideration). However, if the buyer wishes to only buy whenever it wants, and can buy goods from someone other than the seller, the promise is illusory (without consideration) and unenforceable by either party. 

In an output contract, the seller agrees to sell and the buyer agrees to buy all or up to a stated amount of what the seller produces. The UCC imposes a good faith limitation on requirements and output contracts. The quantity under such contracts is the amount of requirements or the amount of output that occurs during a normal production year. The actual quantity purchased or sold cannot be unreasonably disproportionate to normal or comparable prior requirements or output. 
So… the difference between the two is the requirement contracts is dependant on what the buyer needs and an output contract is what the nly up to the extent of what a  producer can produce.

A firm offer arises when a merchant-offeror gives assurance in a signed writing that the offer will remain open. The offer must be both written and signed by the offeror. A merchant’s firm offer is irrevocable without necessity of consideration for the stated period or if no definite period is stated than a reasonable period (not exceeding three months) will be applied. 

Acceptance 
Acceptance of an offer to buy, sell, or lease goods generally may be made in any reasonable manner and by any reasonable means. The UCC permits acceptance of an offer to buy goods “ either by a prompt promise to ship or by the prompt or current shipment of conforming or nonconforming goods. Conforming goods accord with the contract’s terms, whereas non-conforming goods do not. 
The prompt shipment of nonconforming goods constitutes both an acceptance, which creates a contract, and a breach of that contract. This rule does not apply if the seller seasonably (within a reasonable amount of time) notifies the buyer that the nonconforming shipment is offered only as an accommodation,o r a favor. The notice of accommodation, must clearly indicate to the buyer that the shipment does not constitute an acceptance and that, therefore, no contract has been formed.

Example: McFarrell Pharmacy orders five cases of Johnson & Johnson 3-by-5-inch gauze pads from H.T. Medical Supply, Inc. If H.T. ships five cases of Xeroform 3-by-5-inch gauze pads instead, the shipment acts as both an acceptance of McFarrell’s offer and a breach of the resulting contract. McFarrell may sue H.T. for any appropriate damages. If, however, H.T. notifies McFarrell that the Xeroform gauze pads are being shipped as an accommodation because H.T. has only Xeroform pads in stock, the shipment will constitute a counteroffer, not an acceptance. A contract will be formed only if McFarrell accepts the Xeroform gauze pads. 

A notice of acceptance is required. Under the common law, because a lateral offer invites acceptance by performance, the offeree need not to notify the offeror of performance unless the offeror can be accepted by beginning performance. 
	The UCC is more stringent because it requires notification. If the offeror is not notified within a reasonable time that the offeree has accepted the contract by beginning performance, then the offeror can treat the offer as having lapse before acceptance. 

Addition Requirements 

Under the common law, the mirror image rule requires that the terms of the acceptance exactly match those in the offer, and if there is any modification, then there is no contract.
	The UCC takes the position that if the offeree’s response indicates a definite acceptance of the offer, a contract is formed even if the acceptance includes additional or different terms from those contained in the offer. Whether the additional terms become part of the contract depends, in part, on whether the parties are non merchants or merchants. 
	In the following case, a party conditioned its acceptance of an offer on the other parties agreement to additional terms by a specific date. When the parties agreed to the most important terms after the deadline, the court had to decide if there was an enforceable contract. 
	So if at least one party is a non-merchant, then a contract is formed according to the terms of the original offer and not according to the additional terms of acceptance.
And when both parties are merchants, additions terms automatically become part of the contract unless one of the following conditions exist: (1) the original offer expressly limited acceptance to its terms, (2) the new or changed terms materially alter the contract, (3) the offeror objects to the new or changed terms within a reasonable period of time. 


					MIDTERM

Chapter 10---------------- 

Agreement is an offer and acceptance. 
-	Parties must show mutual assent to terms of contract. 
-	Once an agreement is reached, if the other elements of a contract are present, a valid contract is formed.
Requirements of an offer: 
-	Offeror’s serious intention
o	Contract is judged by what a reasonable person in the offeree’s position would conclude after the offer. Offers made in obvious anger, jest, or undue excitement do not meet the requirements of a serious, objective intent. Ex: Lucy v. Zehmer 
	Expressions of opinion is NOT an offer.
	Statement of future intent is NOT an offer.
	Preliminary Negotiations, or invitations to negotiate is NOT an offer.
	Advertisement is NOT an offer (since it only invites to negotiate).
	Agreement to agree: can be seen as an enforceable contract if parties intended to be bound.
	Preliminary agreements: can be binding IF the parties have agreed upon all the essential terms.
-	Definiteness of terms: can that courts can determine if a breach has occurred and give an appropriate remedy. Courts can also supply missing terms if the parties intend to form a contract.  usually, the following terms need be present as follows:
o	The identification of parties
o	Object or subject matter of contract, also the quantity (to make a contract definite) when appropriate, including work to be performed, with specific identification of such items as goods, services, land
o	Consideration to be paid 
o	Time of payment, delivery, or performance. 
-	Communication to offeree
o	The offer must be communicated to the offeree. 
o	Offeree’s knowledge of the offer can be: directly from the offeror, or use of agents. 
-	Termination of the Offer
o	An offer may be terminated prior to acceptance by either: 	
	Action of the parties 
•	Termination by action of the offeror (revocation of offer)
o	Offer can be withdrawn anytime before the offeree accepts the offer, unless the offer is irrevocable. 
o	Effective when the offeree or offeree’s agent receives it. 
•	Termination by action of the offeree (rejection of the offer) 
o	Rejection by the offeree can be expressed or implied which terminates the offer.
o	Effective only when it is received by the offeror or offeror’s agent. 
o	Counteroffer by the offeree: rejection of original offer and the simultaneous making of a new offer.



(CHAPTER 15 ALSO 10) 
GENERAL REVOCATION RULES: Revocation of the offer by the offeror is when the offeror decides to withdraw his offer to the offeree. Revocation is possible and considered effective if:
1)	It is communicated to the offeree before the offer is accepted either directly by the offeror or through a reliable third source AND
2)	The offeree or his agent actually receives some notice of the revocation (the offeree actually knows that the offeror has revoked the offer).
EXCEPTIONS- General revocation rules do not apply in either of these two situations:
1)	OPTION CONTRACTS  - An offeror promises to keep an offer open and not withdraw it for a specified period of time in return for a payment (consideration). It can be made orally or in writing. Once made, this promise CANNOT BE REVOKED. It would be considered a breach of contract.
2)	FIRM OFFERS (no consideration maybe? Need to confirm) – If an offeror (non-merchant or merchant) makes a signed, written promise not to revoke or withdraw an offer for a specified period of time, he CANNOT REVOKE THIS OFFER. Firm offers are treated differently according to whether the offeror is a non-merchant offeror or a merchant offeror.
a)	Non-merchant Offeror – Under NY law, GOL 5-1109, there is no limitation (as long as it is reasonable) on the time specified. Whatever time period promised by the non-merchant offeror in his signed and written firm offer, he is bound to honor.
Merchant Offeror –Under UCC 2-205, if a merchant offeror makes a signed, written firm offer for three months or less he is bound not to revoke that offer during the time period specified. If, however, the merchant offeror makes a signed, written firm offer for more than three months, he has the option to revoke the offer after

	Mirror image rule: at common law, any changes in terms automatically terminates the offer and substitutes the counteroffer. 
	Operation of law: 
•	Lapse of Time: offer terminates by law hen the period of time specified in the offer has passed. 
•	If no time period for acceptance is specified, the offer terminates at the end of a reasonable period of time.
•	Destruction or death: before acceptance of offer, terminates the offer
•	Death or incompetence of the offeror or offeree automatically terminates unless irrevocable offer. 
o	Exception: doesn’t need the offeror to complete the contract that can be completed by a constituent. 
•	Supervening Illegality of the Proposed Contract: legislation or court decision automatically terminates offer or renders contract unenforceable. 
•	Irrevocable offers: courts are unwilling to allow a revocation based on promissory estoppel. (if one is harmed by the offer significantly). 
•	Revocations 
•	Rejection 
-	Acceptance 
o	Voluntary act (expressed or implied),
o	By the offeree that,
o	Shows assent (agreement), 
o	To the terms of an offer
o	Under the “mirror image rule.” 
	Silence as acceptance

Chapter 11------------------

Consideration is defined as the value given in return for a promise. There are two parts to a consideration: (1) something of legally sufficient value must be given in exchange for the promise.
(2) there must be a bargained-for-exchange. 

Legally Sufficient Value must meet one of the following: 
(1) A promise to do something that one has no prior legal duty to do (to pay on receipt of certain goods, for example) 
(2) The performance of an action that one is otherwise not obligated to undertake (such as providing accounting services) 
(3) The refraining from an action that one has a legal right to undertake (called a forbearance). 

Bargained for exchange must provide the basis for the bargain struck between the contracting parties. The item of value must be given or promised by the promisor (offeror) in return for the promisee's promise, performance, or promise of performance. 

Adequacy for consideration involves “how much” consideration is given. In other words, the “fairness” of the bargain. Fairness is not defined in the courts as of equal value if the consideration is legally sufficient. It is not the court’s job to fix unwise contracts. However, when a large disparity arises, such instances usually indicate fraud, duress, or undue influence. Judges are uneasy about enforcing unequal bargains but their task is to make sure that there was not some defect in the contract’s formation that negated voluntary consent. 



Preexisting Duty – legal obligation to do something does not constitute as consideration 
Exception to this rule: if an extraordinary situation arises that was totally unforeseen by both parties.
Past Consideration – a promise after-the-fact is done is not considered legal consideration. 
Illusory promises: if the terms of the contract express such uncertainty of performance that the promisor has definitely promised to do anything, the promise is said to be illusory-- without consideration and unenforceable. 

Changes to the original contract - Any changes that are made to the original contract, it can be done with additional consideration, but it must be signed and written. 
For sales contracts, there has to be good faith, and it can be modified without consideration. 

Settlement of Claims
-	Settlement of liquidated debt (undisputed debt): 
o	A liquidated debt in which the debt is neither in existence nor the amount is disputed by either party.
-	General rule of liquidated debt: a fully matured debt (the debt is past due) liquidated debt cannot be discharged by any amount less than what was originally agreed upon by the parties, even if the creditor orally discharges the debt, because it is a pre-existing legal obligation. 
-	Liquidated Debt Exceptions: 
(1)	The creditor accepts some new or different consideration to discharge the debt. 
(2)	If the debtor gets a signed writing to discharge the balance of the debt (NY law) 
(3)	The debt is not due yet. Example: if you ask the debtor to discharge the debt before the debt is due, then the debtor will win because there was no legal obligation. 
a.	Example: A owes B $100 which is not due until next week. A gives B $50 today in consideration for B’s promise of discharge. B accepts but later sues for the balance of $50. A wins because the debt was not fully matured. A is not legally obligated to pay anything before the due date.
-	 (Settlement of an unliquidated debt): a debt that is disputed as to either its existence or its amount. An unliquidated debt is discharged if an accord and satisfaction has occurred. 
-	Situation #1
o	There is an unliquidated debt AND the debtor decides on his own to send a check to the creditor without prior negotiation, discussion or agreement with the creditor, in full payment of the debt a lesser amount, and the creditor cashes in the check (without writing anything on the back), then accord and satisfaction is met. 
o	Exception: However, if the creditor accepts the check but simply writes “under protest” or “without prejudice” on the back of the check, then the creditor reserves his right to due. 
-	Situation #2 (Settlement of an unliquidated debt): If the debt is settled when the parties negotiate and come to a mutual agreement on the amount due, even if the creditor writes “under protest” or “without prejudice” the creditor will lose if he cashes the check because accord and satisfaction has already been met. 



-	Release: bars a further recovery beyond the terms in the release.
-	Covenant not to sue: means you promise to pay any amount, and I will promise not to sue you. Basically, no set dollar amount. Not to sue for a signed contract and if the person does not pay, then you can sue for breach of contract. 
-	Promissory Estoppel: when you have suffered damage from a promise, you can sue even if there is no contract if the requirements following are met:
o	Must be a clear, definite promise
o	The promisor should have expected that the promise would rely on the promise
o	The promisee reasonably relied on the promise by acting or refraining from something.
o	The promisee’s reliance was definite and resulted in substantial damage. 
o	Enforcement of the promise is necessary to avoid injustice. 

Contractual Capacity 
-	Minors: are considered age 17 and under because the law assumes that minors do not have the mental capacity to understand the law. 
-	General Rule: minor need only return the goods (or other consideration) subject to the contract, provided that the goods are in the minors possession (does not matter if it is in third party), the consideration/good can be damaged, doesn’t matter. 
o	Disaffirmance: any time before the age of 18, or a reasonable time right after the age of 18 (6-11 months), but no later than 19, the minor can choose to avoid the contract. The whole contracts need to be avoid, however, if the minor chooses to do so, and cannot just avoid a portion of the contract.
o	Can be expressed or implied through conduct.
	Exceptions to Disaffirmance: 
•	Contracts for necessaries such as food, medical bills, clothing, etc, however only at a reasonable price, not at market value.
•	Ratification: through conduct or expressly saying to be bounded by a contract, ratifies the contract. 
o	Parent’s liability: parents are not liable unless they co-sign. 
-	Intoxicated Persons 
o	lack of capacity at the time the contract was made
o	court would have you return all consideration if sound to be as such, but seldom happens.
	Exception: Ratification after sobering up: signed during intoxication but still decide to go through after intoxication. ‘
-	Mentally Incompetent Persons
o	Void: if a person has been adjudged mentally incompetent by a court of law and needs a person to care for him at all times. 
o	Voidable: if the person does not know what he or she is entering into contract or lacks the mental capacity to engage in other activities (lucid intervals), (on meds or something)








Chapter 12------------------------- CONDUCT INVALIDATING CONSENT, ETC, ETC 

Voluntary Consent

Mistakes
-	Only a mistake of fact (not value) allows for a contract to be canceled
-	Unilateral mistakes cannot be canceled.
o	Exception: when the other party knows or should have known that a mistake was made.
o	Exception #2: mathematical mistake in addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division. 
-	Bilateral mistakes of fact can be canceled by either party. Furthermore, a word or term in a contract may have more than one reasonable interpretation, mutual misunderstanding may allow the contract to be rescinded. 

Fraudulent Misinterpretation: contract is voidable by innocent party only if the following conditions are met:
o	Misrepresentation of material fact
o	Intent to Deceive requires scienter (guilty knowledge).Reliance of misrepresentation
	Exception: if the party already knows the true facts or relies on obviously extravagant statements. 
o	Needs to have suffered injury to the innocent party
	No proof of injury is required when the action is to rescind contract.
	 Proof of injury is universally required to recover damages.
	Exception: if innocent party has waited too long, then ratification occurs.

•	Misrepresentation by conduct (tries to hide information) 
•	Statements of Opinion are NOT generally subject to claims of fraud. 
o	Exception: if naïve purchases relies on an opinion from an expert, the innocent party may be subject to rescission or reformation (alter contract to reflect true intentions of the parties) 
•	Misrepresentation of law is NOT generally subject to fraud 
o	Exception: unless the persons is in a profession known to require greater knowledge of he law than the average citizen such as real estate brokers or lawyers.
•	Misrepresentation by silence: neither party of a contract is legally obligated to disclose information if no one asks. 
o	Exception: if the seller knows of a serious defect or a serious potential problem that the buyer cannot reasonably be expected to discover, the seller may have a duty to speak. 
•	
Undue Influence: based on conditional or fiduciary relation, or relationship of dependence 
-	 Relationship of trust: doctors, family, lawyers, spouse, husband, etc
-	Prove tthat you relied on this person’s trust, and they took advantage of you.
Duress: forcing a party to enter into a contract under fear or threat makes the contract voidable.
-	Threatened act must be wrongful or illegal or rendered a person of incapable to preform freewill.  





Another defense to enforceability is the form of the contract.


I.	CHAPTER 12 – DEFENSES TO CONTRACT ENFORCEABILITY 
Certain types of contracts must be in writing and signed by the party against whom enforcement is sought to be enforceable.
To be enforceable, the following types of contracts must be in writing and signed:
	Contracts involving an Interest in Land.
A.	EXCEPTIONS:
#1 – Oral leases for 1 year or less are enforceable in court and do not require a writing and therefore are “not within the Statute of Frauds.”
#2 -  An oral real estate contract is enforceable in court and does not require a writing if the purchaser of the land has done all of the following three (3) things:
1.	Paid part of the purchase price and
2.	Took possession of the land and
3.	Made valuable improvements on the land
	Contracts involving “One-Year Rule.”
	A contract that cannot, by its own terms, be performed within one year from the date it was formed.
	One-year period begins to run the day after the contract is made.
•	EXCEPTION: If it is possible (even if it is highly unlikely) for the oral contract to be fully performed within one year from the date it was made, no writing is required. It does not fall within the Statute of Frauds.
-	COLLATERAL PROMISES – if a third party (the promisor/guarantor) makes a promise to a creditor to pay the debt of another person (the debtor), IF THE DEBTOR DOES NOT PAY, this promise must be in writing under the Statute of Frauds to be enforced in court. (Co-signing situation)
-	EXCEPTIONS:
-	#1 – Primary promises – do not require a writing to be enforced. If the promisor makes a promise to be directly responsible for the debt – this transaction does not fall within the Statute of Frauds.
-	
-	#2 – Main Purpose Rule – if the purpose of the promise made by the   promisor/guarantor is for his own benefit (collateral promises are usually made as a favor to the debtor) then this promise does not require a writing to be enforced.
o	Promise Made in Consideration of Marriage.
	Unilateral promise to make monetary payment or gift in consideration of a promise to marry must be in writing.
	Same applies to prenuptial agreements.
-	CONTRACTS FOR THE SALE OF GOODS $500 OR MORE – must be in writing under the UCC. This rule applies to everyone, merchants and non- merchants alike.
-	EXCEPTIONS:
-	#1 – Chapter 15, p. 395 (“Special Rules for Contracts between Merchants- also referred to as “Merchant Memo Rule”):
-	2 merchants, Merchant A and Merchant B, make an oral contract for the sale of goods $500 or more. Merchant A sends Merchant B a signed, written confirmation letter of the oral contract. Merchant B has 10 days upon receiving this letter to send a written objection letter. If there is no written objection response from Merchant B then this confirmation letter can be used later as evidence of the oral contract and it will be enforced in court. No writing would be required.
-	#2 – Chapter 15 – p.395 (“Specially Manufactured Goods”) –
-	An oral contract for the sale of goods $500 or more is enforceable and does not require a writing if (1) the goods are custom made, (2) the goods cannot be resold in the marketplace and (3) the seller already substantially started to make the goods.
Exceptions to Statues of Fraud
-	Partial performance: when a contract has been partially performed and the parties cannot return back to its original positions, then the court may grant specific performance. 
-	Admission: if a party under the UCC law admits that a sale contract was made, then it is enforceable to the extent of admission. 

Chapter 14------------------

•	Most Common Remedies:
	Damages.
•	Compensatory Damages. (to cover direct cost and loss) 
•	Designed to compensate non-breaching party for loss of the bargain.
•	Actually sustained, out-of-pocket costs, directly arising from breach.
•	Standard Measure: difference between value of promised performance and value of actual performance.  
•	Incidental Damages: expenses cause directly by breach of contract.
•	Measurement of Damages:
•	Sale of Goods: difference between contract and market price.
•	Sale of Land: specific performance.
•	Consequential (Special) Damages—foreseeable losses.
•	Breaching party is aware or should be aware, cause the injury party additional loss
•	Punitive Damages—punish or deter future conduct.
•	Generally, not available for mere breach of contract. Usually tort (e.g., fraud) is also involved.
•	Nominal Damages—no financial loss. 
•	Mitigation of Damages.
	When breach of contract occurs, the innocent injured party is held to a duty to reduce the damages that he or she suffered.
	Duty owed depends on the nature of the contract: Employment vs. Rental Agreements
•	Liquidated Damages versus Penalties.
	Liquidated Damages: specific amount agreed to be paid as damages in the event of future breach.
-	Penalties: designed to penalize, generally unenforceable.	

	Rescission and Restitution (equitable remedies) 
•	Rescission: Remedy whereby a contract is canceled and the parties are restored to the original positions that they occupied prior to the transactions.  à
•	Restitution: Both parties must return goods, property, or money previously conveyed. Note: Rescission does not always call for restitution. Restitution is called for in some cases not involving rescission.
•	
	Specific Performance
•	Equitable remedy calling for the performance of the act promised in the contract.
•	Provides remedy in cases involving: 
•	Sale of Land.
•	Contracts for Personal Services.
•	
	Reformation
•	Equitable remedy allowing a contract to be reformed, or rewritten to reflect the parties’ true intentions.
•	When Fraud or Mutual Mistake is Present: most common use of reformation.
•	Written Contract Incorrectly States Parties’ Oral Agreement.
•	Covenants Not to Compete (CNTC): courts may reform the contract if the constraints are unreasonable, or my find the entire contract unenforceable.
	Recovery Based on Quasi Contract.	
•	Arises when no contract actually exists.  Equitable remedy created by courts to obtain justice and prevent unjust enrichment.
•	Party conferring benefit can recover in quantum meruit (“as much as she deserves”).
	Requirements of Quasi Contract.
•	Benefit was conferred to the other party.
•	Party conferring benefit reasonably expected to be paid.
•	The benefit was not volunteered.
•	Receiving benefit without paying for it would result in unjust enrichment.
•	EXCEPTION: cannot be for personal services
Injunction: can force a person to not do something until the contract is over. 


Chapter 13

-	Discharge by performance: Both parties fulfill their respective duties by performing the acts they have promised.
o	Complete performance: Parties perform exactly as agreed, or ‘perfect.’  
o	Substantial Performance: party who performs substantially in good faith can enforce the contract.
	Confers Most of the Benefits Promised: performance must not vary greatly from what was promised.
-	Material Breach of Contract: A  breach of Contract  is the nonperformance of a contractual duty.
o	A material breach occurs when performance is not substantial, and nonbreaching party is excused from performance and entitled to damages.
o	In a minor (non-material) breach, the duty to perform is not excused and the non-breaching party must resume performance of the contractual obligations undertaken.
-	Anticipatory Repudiation: Before performance is due, one party may refuse to perform his or her contractual obligation. Treated as a material breach, and nonbreaching party may sue for damages immediately, even though performance is not due.à
-	Discharge by Rescission: 
o	Mutual Rescission: for executory contract, parties must make a new contract, oral or written. Under UCC, however, contracts must be in writing. 
	If one party has performed, agreement to rescind must have additional consideration.
o	
o	
-	Frustration of Purpose: Supervening event make it impossible to attain purpose both parties had in mind.
o	Event must not have been reasonably foreseeable, and decreases value of what a party receives under contract.
-	Impossibility of Performance: Supervening event was not foreseeable.
o	When impossibility can occur:
	Death or Incapacitation in personal contract prior to performance, 
	Destruction of the Subject Matter; or
	Change in Law makes Contract Illegal.
o	Temporary Impossibility: suspends performance until the impossibility ceases.
o	Commercial Impracticability: Performance becomes extremely difficult or costly. Conditions not known at contracting.


QUIZ 2 (4, 17, 5, 6, 25)

Chapter 4: Tort ----------- 

-	Torts are wrongful actions.
-	Business torts involve wrongful interference with the business rights of others, including vague concepts as unfair competition and wrongfully interfering with the business relation of another. 
-	The purpose of tort law is to provide remedies for the invasion of various protected interests such as physical safety, protecting real and personal property, protecting certain intangible interests (such as reputation).
-	Compensatory damages are intended to compensate plaintiffs for actual losses in order to me the plaintiffs whole. 
-	Special damages compensate for quantifiable monetary losses, such as medical expenses, lost wages and benefits, extra costs, loss of irreplaceable items, etc. 
-	General damages compensate individuals (not companies) for the nonmonetary aspect of the harm suffered, such as pain and suffering. 
-	Punitive damages may sometimes be awarded if the defendant’s conduct was particularly bad or reprehensible, usually only awarded in intentional torts.
-	An intentional tort requires intent. The tortfeasor (one committing the tort) must intend to commit the act, the consequences of which interfere with the personal or business interests of another in a way not permitted by the law. A motive is not required. Intent means only that the actor intended the consequences of his or her actions or knew with substantial certain that his or her actions would result in something from the act. Generally, normal consequences of their actions are assumed. 
-	Assault and Battery: Assault is any intentional and unexcused threat of immediate harmful or offensive contact, including words or acts that create another person a reasonable apprehension of harmful contact. Battery is the completion of the assault. Once again, no motive is necessary because torts only require the intent. 
o	Defenses for assault and battery: (1) defense of property, (2) self-defense, (3) consent 
-	False imprisonment: Confinement or restraint of another person’s activities without justification.
o	Defenses for imprisonment: (1) Merchants can detain a suspected shoplifter as long as there is probable cause.
-	Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress: an extreme and outrageous act, intentional committed, that is unacceptable to society, that results in severe emotional distress to another. Such as stalking and making threats at the same time.  Some courts require physical symptoms.
-	Defamation: Publication of a false statement (oral or written) that injures a person’s good reputation. Opinions are free speech and generally not actionable.
o	Slander is oral. You need prove monetary loss for specific damages because statements have a temporary quality. 
	Exceptions: Slander per se: statements regarding loathsome disease, professional improprieties, serious crimes, or being unchaste. Do not have to prove losses to receive award.  
o	Libel is written. You do not need to prove that monetary losses. Reason: libel is “permanent” and continues to harm after statement made. 
o	Publication Requirement: third party must hear or see statement.
o	Publication may be privileged, absolute (statements made in courtrooms by attorney) and qualified (statements that are made in good faith by an employer or something because he or she is qualified to do so). 
o	Truth is normally an absolute defense against defamation. 
o	Public Figures: plaintiff must show statement made with “actual malice,” deliberate attempt to cause harm with either knowledge of its falsity or reckless disregard of truth. 
-	Invasion of the Right to Privacy: A person has the right to solitude. Breach of that duty is a tort. Intrusion into private affairs or seclusion. False Light. Public disclosure of private facts.
-	Appropriation: Use of another person’s name, likeness or other identifying characteristic, without permission, with benefit to user.
o	Right of Publicity as a property right: focuses on commercial exploitation of likeness
-	Fraudulent Misrepresentation: Intentional deception of another that causes belief in a condition that is different from the condition that already exists.  
o	Includes several elements: (1) Knowing misrepresentation of fact, (2) Intent to induce innocent party to rely on that fact, (3) Justifiable reliance by innocent party, (4) Damage suffered, (5) causal connection between misrepresentation and injury. 
	“puffery” or statements of opinion, or sellers talk is not fraudulent misrepresentation. 
-	Negligent Misrepresentation: when the person didn’t know the statement was false and only typically occurs when person owes a duty to another to give correct information.
-	Wrongful Interference with Contractual Relationship: when there is valid, enforceable contract, and the third party knows about the contract, but still intentionally causes either party to breach the original contract. 
o	Distinguish competition vs. predatory behavior. Predatory behavior is unlawfully driving competitors out of market. To prevail, Plaintiff must show Defendant targeted only Plaintiff’s customers and product. 
o	Defenses to Wrongful Interference: Interference was justified or permissible (bona fide competitive behavior).
-	Trespass to Land: Occurs when a person, without permission, enters onto, above, or below surface of land owned by another. Actual harm to the land is not required. Guest who refuse to leave, or intruders. Posted “Trespass” signs. Also, owners have the duty to post that guard dogs are patrolling the premise, etc. Kids are usually not held liable for trespassing if they are attracted to some object in the property. 
-	Trespass to Personal Property: Wrongfully taking or harm or interference with exclusive right of use of personal property (chattel) of another.
o	Conversion: Wrongfully taking or retaining possession of chattel and placing in service of another. Usually occurs with trespass to personal property.
-	Disparagement of Property: Occurs when economically injurious falsehoods are made about another’s property or product. 	
o	Slander of Quality (Trade Libel): false statement about another’s product that caused a third party to refrain from dealing with plaintiff, causing financial loss
o	Slander of Title: false statement about legal ownership of another’s product resulting in financial loss.



-	A tort of negligence occurs when plaintiff is legally injured due to defendant’s failure to live up to a required duty of care causing foreseeable risk of injury.
-	Negligence Analysis: 
o	Did the Defendant owe the Plaintiff a legal duty of care?
o	Did the Defendant breach that duty?
o	Did the Plaintiff suffer a legal injury?
o	Did the Defendant’s breach of duty cause the Plaintiff’s injury?

-	Duty is based on the reasonable person standard. 
-	How would a reasonable person have acted under the circumstances.	
o	Duty of Landowners to warn business invitees of risks, and keep common areas safe.  Exception: Obvious risks.
o	Duty of Professionals to clients (attorneys, CPA’s, doctors).
o	Plaintiff must prove the tortious act was both the cause in fact and proximate cause of the injury.
o	Causation in Fact: “but for” defendant’s act, injury would not have occurred.
o	Proximate Cause: defendant’s act created a foreseeable risk of injury to plaintiff (sufficient strong connection).
o	Plaintiff must suffer a legally recognizable injury.
	Plaintiff must show she suffered loss or harm to legally protected interest.
	Not all injuries can be compensated.
	Compensatory damages are norm. Punitive damages are generally awarded only in intentional torts.
o	
-	Defenses of negligence: 
o	Assumption of the Risk: knowing the risks/notified of risks. Not applied in emergency situations.
o	Superseding Cause: Event must be unforeseeable
o	
-	Contributory and Comparative Negligence.
o	Contributory Negligence: uncommon. If plaintiff is at 1% fault, no award. 
o	Comparative Negligence (more common). If plaintiff is less than 50% at fault, he can recover a “pro-rata” share of verdict. 
	As long as Plaintiff is less than 50% at fault he can recover a pro-rata share of the verdict.
-	

- Negligence Per Se: violation of law is legal breach of duty.  Plaintiff must show: 
Defendant broke a law/statute.
o	Plaintiff is in special class to be protected;
o	Statute designed to prevent injury to Plaintiff.
-	Res Ipsa Loquitur: when facts speak for themselves and it is up to the defendant to prove he or she was not negligent. 
-	Negligence Per Se: violation of law is legal breach of duty.  Plaintiff must show:
o	 Defendant broke a law/statute.
o	Plaintiff is in special class to be protected;
o	Statute designed to prevent injury to Plaintiff.
-	Strict liability: Does not require fault, intent or breach of duty. Usually involves ‘abnormally dangerous’ activities and risk cannot be prevented. Strict Liability holds people liable for results of their acts, regardless of their intentions or exercise of reasonable care.  
-	Strict liability also applies to wild animals considered dangerous and undomesticated. 
-	Strict liability also applies in the area of product liability: Liability—manufacturers and sellers of harmful or defective products
-	


Chapter 17----------------

-	Product Liability can be based on:
o	Negligence 
	Claim based on a manufacturer’s breach of the reasonable standard of care.
	Due Care Must Be Exercised in: design, selection of materials, using appropriate production process, assembling and testing, adequate warnings, inspection, and testing.  
	Privity of Contract Not Required. No privity of contract required between Plaintiff and Manufacturer. Liability extends to any person’s injuries caused by a negligently made (defective) product. (relationship that exists between the promisor and the promisee of a contract. 
	
o	Misrepresentation
	Occurs when fraud committed against consumer or user of product. Fraud must have been made knowingly or with reckless disregard for safety.
	The intentional mislabeling of packaged cosmetics or the intentional concealment of a product’s defects constitutes fraudulent misrepresentation. Of course, to bring a law suit, the plaintiff must prove that he or she relied on the misrepresentation. 
	Plaintiff does not have to show product was defective.
o	Strict Liability and Public Policy. 
	Strict Liability holds people liable for results of their acts, regardless of their intentions or exercise of reasonable care.  
	Consumers should be protected from unsafe products;
	Manufacturers and distributors should be liable to any user of the product;
	Manufacturers, sellers and distributors can bear the costs of injuries.  à
	Requirements for Strict Liability: 
•	Product must be in defective condition when sold.
•	Defendant is in the business of selling the product.
•	Product must be unreasonably dangerous
•	Plaintiff must be physically harmed
•	Defective condition must be proximate cause of injury.
•	Goods are in substantially same condition.
•	
o	Proving a Defective Condition: Plaintiff does not need to show product or in what manner the product become defective. But plaintiff must show product was defective and “unreasonably dangerous” to the user.  
o	Unreasonably Dangerous Products: The product was dangerous beyond the expectation of the ordinary consumer. A less dangerous alternative was economically feasible for the manufacturer, but the manufacturer failed to produce it.
•	
•	
•	
	Manufacturing Defects: Occurs when a product “departs from its intended design even though all possible care was exercised in the preparation and marketing of the product.” This is to encourage greater investment in product safety. 
•	
	Design Defects: Product is manufactured correctly, but defect is based on design.  A product is defective in design when foreseeable risks of harm posed by the product could have been reduced or avoided by the adoption of a reasonable alternative design by the seller. 
	 Test for Design Defects: plaintiff must show defendant’s failure to use a reasonable alternative design rendered the product not reasonably safe. 
•	Factors to be Considered.
o	Magnitude and probability of foreseeable risks. 
o	Relative advantages and disadvantages of product.
o	Most courts use “risk-utility” analysis.
	Inadequate Warnings: Content: a product may be defective because of inadequate warnings or instructions. Liability based on foreseeability that proper instructions/labels would have made the product safe to use. 
•	Obvious Risks: no duty to warn.
-	Market Share Liability: Theory of liability when multiple Defendants contributed to manufacture of defective product. Liability of each Defendant is proportionate to the share of the market held by each respective Defendant. Strict liability also applies to suppliers of component parts.
-	Defenses to Product Liability
o	Assumption of Risk.
o	Product Misuse. 
o	Comparative Negligence.
o	Commonly Known Dangers.
o	Knowledgeable User.

Chapter 5------------------

I.	Intellectual Property – any property that is the product of an individual’s mind (EX. books, software, movies, and music).
A)	Trade name – The name of a business can be protected, but it cannot be merely descriptive, unless it has developed a secondary meaning over five years of use. (For example, the word apple is the descriptive word for a type of fruit, but it has been for many years strongly identified with the “Apple” corporation.)
B)	Trademarks –a trademark is a distinctive mark, motto, device or emblem that a manufacturer stamps, prints, or otherwise affixes to the goods it produces so that they may be identified on the market and their origins made known. It applies to products. SEE CASE, P.120 – “The Coca-Cola Co. v. Koke Co. of America”.

1.	Trademark Infringement/ What marks are protected?
a)	Once a trademark has been established under common law or through registration of the trademark with the US Patent and Trademark Office or a state trademark registration office, it gives notice on a nationwide basis that the trademark belongs exclusively to the registrant. When someone else uses the trademark in its entirety or copies it to a substantial degree, intentionally or unintentionally, trademark infringement has occurred. 
b)	The owner has to prove that the defendant’s use of the mark created a likelihood of confusion about the origin of the defendant’s goods or services. The owner DOES NOT have to prove that the trademark was registered.
c)	The most commonly granted remedy for the owner of a trademark is an injunction to prevent further infringement.

C)	Patents – a government grant that gives an inventor the exclusive right to make, use, and sell an invention for a period of twenty years. Patents for designs are given for a fourteen year period.

1.	What is patentable and therefore protected? – An item must be novel and not “obvious”. Almost anything is patentable (excluding laws of nature, natural phenomena and abstract ideas). For example, genetically engineered plants and animals are patentable while plants or animals that grow naturally are not patentable.
2.	Patent Infringement 
a)	Is the manufacture, use, or sale of another’s product or design without permission.
b)	If a patent is infringed, the patent holder can seek an injunction and may request damages for royalties and lost profits.

Examples of protected copyrighted works include books, records, films, art work, music videos, architectural plans, restaurant menus, product packaging, and computer software. A compilation of facts is also protected where a work is formed by the collection and assembling of pre-existing materials or of data that are selected, coordinated or arranged in such a way that the resulting work constitutes  an original work of authorship.

2.	Copyright Infringement
a)	Occurs whenever the form or expression of an idea is copied. The reproduction does not have to be exactly the same as the original, nor does it have to reproduce the original in its entirety. If a substantial part of the original is reproduced, copyright infringement has occurred.
b)	Those who infringe copyrights may be liable for damages or criminal penalties.

c)	The “Fair Use” Exception – A person or organization may not be liable for copyright infringement and therefore, may not have to pay royalties to the copyright owner, if the “Fair Use” exception applies. Under the “Fair Use” Doctrine:
It is not an infringement of copyright laws if a person or organization reproduces copyrighted work for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching (including multiple copies for classroom use), scholarship, or research. The purpose and character of the use must be for nonprofit educational purposes and not of a commercial nature.

Chapter 25 Employment Law-------------------

CHAPTER 25 NOTES- EMPLOYMENT LAW
I.	EMPLOYMENT DISCRIMINATION
If a person does not have an employment contract they are considered to be an employee-at-will which means that they can be fired for any reason. However, if an employee can prove a case based on employment discrimination, they may sue the employer. There are both state and federal anti-discrimination laws that protect employees against discrimination in the workplace. Certain protected classes of persons are protected under federal law:

A.	Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964
1)	Prohibits job discrimination against employees, applicants, and union members on the basis of race, color, national origin, religion or gender at any stage of employment.
2)	It applies to employers with 15 or more employees, labor unions with 15 or more members, employment agencies, state and local agencies, and most federal employment.
3)	It is monitored by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) who investigates allegations of discrimination (“priority cases”).
4)	Includes prohibition of discrimination against pregnant women and sexual harassment.
5)	If plaintiff is successful in his lawsuit – he may be awarded reinstatement, back pay, retroactive promotions, and damages.
B.	Age Discrimination
1)	Age in Discrimination Act (ADEA) prohibits discrimination on the basis of age of persons 40 years or older.
2)	It applies to employers with 20 or more employees and employer’s business activities must affect interstate commerce.
C.	Discrimination based on Disability
1)	The Americans with Disabilities Act prohibits discrimination against disabled persons in the workplace.
2)	It applies to employers with 15 or more workers.

*** TO PROVE A DISCRIMINATION CASE, PLAINTIFF HAS TO PROVE:
1)	HE/SHE IS A LEGALLY RECOGNIZED MEMBER OF A PROTECTED CLASS
2)	IS QUALIFIED FOR THE JOB AND

3)	WAS FIRED BECAUSE THEY ARE A MEMBER OF A PROTECTED CLASS.
(For example, Tom would like to file a claim based on the Americans with Disabilities Act. He has to prove that (1) he was disabled, (2) was qualified for the job, and (3) he was fired because of his disability.

**DEFENSE OF A DEFENDANT – A defense available to a defendant in a discrimination case is that the alleged discrimination was a “business necessity”(Conduct that was perceived as discrimination was actually for legitimate purposes such as safety concerns for the employee).



II.	EMPLOYEE PROTECTION
A.	Whistleblower Statutes- New York provides very limited protection for private employees who are fired for disclosing, objecting to, or refusing to engage in an activity, practice, or policy of the employer that the employee believes to be illegal. Under New York law, a private employee is protected from wrongful discharge based on whistleblowing only if the challenged activity of the employer presented a substantial and specific danger to the public health and safety and also constituted an actual violation of  a law, rule, or regulation. A
public employee has broader whistleblower protection.
B.	Limited NY Protection – In addition to whistleblowing laws, NY also has the following employee protection laws:
1.	Anti-discrimination laws
2.	Laws protecting employees from retaliation for serving on jury duty, pursuing workers’ compensation claims, and engaging in legal activities off the job.
C.	Other Employee Protection Statutes
1.	Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) – ensures a safe and healthful working environment for workers.
2.	Workers’ Compensation – entitles employees to compensation if they are injured, as a result of or in the course of their employment.
3.	Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) – regulates the employment of child labor and establishes the minimum wage and overtime rate.
